		<h2>What happened after the 1998 Championship?</h2>
		<p>Everything sort of failed. Jordan retired and the team traded away both Pippen and Rodman. Kukoƒç lead the team for a year or so, but he alone was not enough to keep a team afloat. The team floundered until Derrick Rose was drafted in 2008.</p><br>
		
		<h2>Derrick Rose Era</h2>
		<p>Derrick Rose created a lot of buzz around Bulls basketball. Him and the hiring of coach Tom Thibodeau would lead the Bulls to 50-16 record and a first overall seed in the East. But Rose would tear his ACL in the first game of the series and was really never the same after that. Rose would be traded in 2016 and the Bulls have been rebuilding ever since.</p>
